                Now pickles have a simple but genius origin, but what most don't know is the sad story of the creators death.
                One hot morning Samule B. Pickling decided to try and pickle an onion, having had such great success with
                his pickled pickle invention. He started by prepping his work station, when suddenly he tripped falling mouth
                first into a carelessly left behind pickle. Poor Samuel B Pickling died choking on his pickle, found
                by his widow the Dutchess Pickling. In his honor his sons Rick and Morty carried his legacy on, adding new members 
                to the Pickling family.
